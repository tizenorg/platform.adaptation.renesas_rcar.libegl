EGL wrapper library for Wayland.

This EGL library wraps IMG's OpenGL/ES library.

This library assumes that the real EGL library is either set in the environment
variable LIBEGL or the name is libEGL-pvr.so for now. Yes, it's hard coded.

It also assumes that the EGL library could be loaded with dlopen(). Make sure
that the library exists in the search path.

This package behaves as a Mesa library. In order to support various wayland-egl
apps we also install the following package configs:

- egl.pc	(has to be >= 7.10)
- glesv2.pc

The package configs above will refer IMG library and this library.
